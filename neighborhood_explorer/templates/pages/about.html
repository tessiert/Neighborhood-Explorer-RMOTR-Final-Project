<p>This site is currently under active development, and represents my final project
for the <a href ="https://rmotr.com/">RMOTR</a> "Web Development with Django" 
program.  When all features have been implemented, it will enable a user to 
enter some or all of a U.S. address, and will then present information about the
given location such as:  a three-day weather forecast, an interactive map and 
check-box selection mechanism for the exploration of attractions and points of 
interest in the area, and finally, relevant demographic information.  
I start by using <a href="https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/geocoding-api/">
Mapquest's geolocation API</a> to convert the input location into latitude and 
longitude coordinates, and then use these to pull weather information from the 
<a href="https://darksky.net/dev">Dark Sky weather API</a>.  The next task I 
have planned is to pull and display points of interest information from the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro">Google Places
API</a>, and finally demographic information from an API that is yet to be
determined.</p>

<p>This site also provides its own API endpoint at 
<a href="http://Neighborhood-Explorer.herokuapp.com/api/">
http://Neighborhood-Explorer.herokuapp.com/api/</a> which allows GET requests,
and will return JSON containing information on how many times each City/State
combination in the database (PostgreSQL is used) has been searched.  It is this 
API that is accessed by the home page in order to construct the "Top Searches"
results - employing a very simple in-house microservices architecture approach.
