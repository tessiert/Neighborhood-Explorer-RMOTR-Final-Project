<p>This site is currently under active development, and represents my final project
for the <a href ="https://rmotr.com/">RMOTR</a> "Web Development with Python and Django" 
program.  It enables a user to enter some or all of a U.S. address, and then 
retrieves and displays information about the given location - a three-day 
weather forecast and a map and drop-down selection mechanism for the exploration 
of attractions and other points of interest in the area.</p>  

<p>I start by using <a href="https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/geocoding-api/">
Mapquest's geocoding API</a> to convert the input location into latitude and 
longitude coordinates, and then use these to pull weather information from the 
<a href="https://darksky.net/dev">Dark Sky weather API</a>.  After that, and
based on user selection criteria, I pull points of interest information from the 
<a href="https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/search-api/v4/swagger/">
Mapquest Place Search API</a> 
and use this information to populate an appropriately scaled map from the
<a href="https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/static-map-api/v5/map">
Mapquest Static Map API</a> with location markers, as well as to retrieve a 
text address of the site that is transformed into a link to further information
using a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1">Google Maps API</a>.</p>

<p>This site also provides its own API endpoint at 
<a href="http://Neighborhood-Explorer.herokuapp.com/api/">
http://Neighborhood-Explorer.herokuapp.com/api</a> which allows GET requests,
and will return JSON containing information on how many times each City/State
combination in the database (PostgreSQL is used) has been searched.  It is this 
API that is accessed by the home page in order to construct the "Top Searches"
results - employing a very simple in-house microservices architecture approach.
